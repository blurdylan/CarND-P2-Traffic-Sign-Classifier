This repo contains code for images of traffic sign classification from German Traffic Sign Database GTSRB. Originally, it was the task of the second project from Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree, but now there are some my independent experiments added. The train dataset consists of 39209 images with 32x32 px resolution, test dataset - 12630. The datasets were provided by Udacity Program.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project were the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a [written report](./writeup.md)

## Dependencies
This project requires:
* jupyter-notebook with Anaconda or Python
* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab environment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

## Files
The project is contained in a jupyter notebook [`Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb`](./Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) from which you can run using the carnd kernel mentionned above.

The project has been runned and its output saved in the [`Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html`](./Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html) file
